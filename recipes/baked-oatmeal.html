        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 and 3/4 cups (420ml) milk (dairy or nondairy)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120ml) pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (4 Tbsp; 56g) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (60g) unsweetened applesauce or mashed banana
            </li>
            <li>3 cups (255g) old-fashioned whole rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder
            </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
            </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt
            </li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups (225g) fresh or frozen mixed berries, (do not thaw)</li>
            <li>optional for topping: 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
        <div class="steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower third position and preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray a 9×9 inch or 11×7 inch baking pan with nonstick spray. Any similar size or shape pan works, though 8×8 inch would be too small. See recipe note for 9×13 inch pan.</li>
            <li>Whisk all of the ingredients together in 1 large bowl. Pour into prepared baking pan. Top with nuts, if desired. (Or stir into the oatmeal.) Bake for 35 minutes or until the center appears *almost* set, which gives us a soft oatmeal as pictured above. For drier and more solid baked oatmeal, bake until center has set.</li>
            <li>Cool for 5 minutes before serving. Spoon or slice and serve with yogurt, if desired. Cover leftovers tightly and refrigerate for up to 1 week.</li>
        </ol>
